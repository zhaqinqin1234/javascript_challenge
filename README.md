# javascript_challenge
In this homewokr, need to write code that will create a table dynamically based upon a dataset provided. We also need to allow our users to filter the table data for specific values. There's a catch though... we only use pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js on our web pages. They are the only coding languages which can be trusted.
